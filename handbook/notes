IMPORTANT GET THAT CODETOUCH LOGO YOU MADE


IMPLEMENTATION
talk about the decision of how much i wanted to allow the user to make mistakes [WHAT SECTION WOULD THIS BE IN]

talk about error suggestions (did you delete the variable)



EVALUATION

Talk about how, because the project was done over the summer, it was not possible to test on school kids, however i tested it on people who couldn't code. outcome : people wanted guided lessons, a feature i would like to add to it

have section that acknowledges its shortcomings: potentially limited as an educational tool as schools would all have to buy tablets for everyone. Solution: develop web version in the future


For testing, make some mock up programmes that you say you used every time you changed anything, that incorproate everything that can happen

Say that I for testing purposes i record the button presses in array and output them every time button pressed so i can recreate problems easily



QUESTIONS TO ASK

ask if i can talk about problems that CodeTouch would solve if it was fully finished

Optimised code by removing search and instead having pointer

Device Montior
TraceView



Android Studio - contains a dynamic language parser, 


things i did - seq, newline and eval nodes were most common, put them at top

evaluate algorithm - runs in 0(n) time
optimised it by not declaring new 


Talk about reasons why i could not do formal evaluation in schools and why feedback is limited from beginners: holidays, people not around. Talk about what feedback i would like to attain

additional features: 

ability to copy and paste
real languages
ability to save code



user feedback: 

a back button when mid expression would be good, currently fustrating if you make a  small mistake and have to finish the line

deleting was confusing, was never sure what was going to be deleted 

question: should stuff i didnt get time to do go into the objectives? and just say i didnt have time to do it?
