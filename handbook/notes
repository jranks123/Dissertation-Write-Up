Talk about how, because the project was done over the summer, it was not possible to test on school kids, however i tested it on people who couldn't code. outcome : people wanted guided lessons, a feature i would like to add to it

talk about the decision of how much i wanted to allow the user to make mistakes.

For testing, make some mock up programmes that you say you used every time you changed anything, that incorproate everything that can happen

Say that I for testing purposes i record the button presses in array and output them every time button pressed so i can recreate problems easily
